            Hello, my name is Abhishek and I am a data science student. I have always been interested in the field of data analysis and data-driven decision-making. Currently, I am pursuing my studies in data science and I have gained a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, R and SQL, as well as machine learning techniques and data visualization tools. I have also gained experience working on various data science projects, which has helped me to develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills. Overall, I am passionate about the field of data science and I am excited about the opportunities it provides to use data to make informed decisions and drive business success
